Dimensions side -> Integrtaion Quick Setup is clicked
 - TIP Dashbaord is loaded in a new tab (no sign in required, somehow the token should retrieved and sent to TIP)
 - TIP UI needs to be updated to receive the login params and skip the regular login flow
 	- Add Dimensions IDP to Dashboard
 	- Display company name if user comes from PRO -> DImensions
 	- Don't display company name if user comes from Dimensions only
 	- Populate username
 	- Schedule a meeting with Mark and Will to ask a few questions related to this
 - Last Run and Status will be displayed for Joint Customer, for now it'll be blank unless Dimensions sends us the info
 - Schedule column in the Dashboard for boomi integrations is not a cron expresion, UI needs to be updated to show the right value
 	- Q: How are we going to implement this? 
 	- A: 
 - For 2c ask in the StandUp Teams chat (Question 1)
 - Sign Out option in TIP shouldnâ€™t be provided for the users coming from Dimensions
 - For 5aa, we'll need to check schedule transfer field and if it's null/empty, proceed to delete the integration. If not, then display message from the PRD doc
 - For 6a, we need to update change history ro include new trasnfer fields used in Boomi integrations
 - Think about how to deploy metadata for the multiple Boomi templates given we're gonna have multiple DCs
 - For 7e, further discussion is needed to know how it'll be implemented




Questions:
1. How do we know where the user came from before he/she was on Dimensions? (How do we know the user come from Pro -> Dimensions -> TIP Dashbaord or just Dimensions -> TIP Dashboard)
	- Answer: Dimensions will add a query param so that dashboard knows the user is coming from Dimensions
2. How does TIP know what IDP to use when coming from dimensions, given that dimensions is not our OPP authn identity provider
3. For 2H, is it fair to assume "All the integrations" refers to all Boomi Integrations?
4. What should TIP do about previously created integrations in Dimensions? TIP won't have that info unless there's some kind of migration
5. For 4a, are you referring to Run in the TIP Dashboard main screen (kabab menu) or in the Scheduling Page (or both)?
6. For 4a, is the second bulletpoint referring to last status and last run date?
7. For 5a, we already display a confirmation message but with different text
8. For 5aa, is there a way to delete a schedule for an integration in Dimensions? Because if it's not possible, how would the user delete an integration in the UI side?
9. For 7d, what should we do for joint customers
10. 



This will permanently delete test scheduler rerun dates. Are you sure?
