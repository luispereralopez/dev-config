Dimensions side -> Integrtaion Quick Setup is clicked
 - TIP Dashbaord is loaded in a new tab (no sign in required, somehow the token should retrieved and sent to TIP)
 - TIP UI needs to be updated to receive the login params and skip the regular login flow
 	- Add Dimensions IDP to Dashboard
 	- Display company name if user comes from PRO -> DImensions
 	- Don't display company name if user comes from Dimensions only
 	- Populate username
 	- Schedule a meeting with Mark and Will to ask a few questions related to this
 - Last Run and Status will be displayed for Joint Customer, for now it'll be blank unless Dimensions sends us the info
 - Schedule column in the Dashboard for boomi integrations is not a cron expresion, UI needs to be updated to show the right value
 	- Q: How are we going to implement this? 
 	- A: 
 - For 2c ask in the StandUp Teams chat (Question 1)
 - Sign Out option in TIP shouldnâ€™t be provided for the users coming from Dimensions
 - For 5aa, we'll need to check schedule transfer field and if it's null/empty, proceed to delete the integration. If not, then display message from the PRD doc
 - For 6a, we need to update change history ro include new trasnfer fields used in Boomi integrations
 - Think about how to deploy metadata for the multiple Boomi templates given we're gonna have multiple DCs
 - For 7e, further discussion is needed to know how it'll be implemented
 - We dont support links in static page entries, pending question to review in the PRD
 - Need to implement radio buttons in static page entry
 - Need to check if there's a security implication of stringify the CRT csv file uploaded in the client side (stringified version of csv will be sent to the BE to be uploaded to Boomi later)

Questions:
1. How do we know where the user came from before he/she was on Dimensions? (How do we know the user come from Pro -> Dimensions -> TIP Dashbaord or just Dimensions -> TIP Dashboard)
	- Answer: Dimensions will add a query param so that dashboard knows the user is coming from Dimensions
2. How does TIP know what IDP to use when coming from dimensions, given that dimensions is not our OPP authn identity provider
3. For 2H, is it fair to assume "All the integrations" refers to all Boomi Integrations?
4. What should TIP do about previously created integrations in Dimensions? TIP won't have that info unless there's some kind of migration
5. For 4a, are you referring to Run in the TIP Dashboard main screen (kabab menu) or in the Scheduling Page (or both)?
6. For 4a, is the second bulletpoint referring to last status and last run date?
7. For 5a, we already display a confirmation message but with different text
8. For 5aa, is there a way to delete a schedule for an integration in Dimensions? Because if it's not possible, how would the user delete an integration in the UI side?
9. For 7d, what should we do for joint customers
10. Don't understand 8b

- Do CRTs depend on Parameters? Also, if we're going to PRD needs to be updated to reflect the parameters that will be used in metadata for CRTs and GP.
- Sync attach/install iPack and create CRTs in Boomi, and load GP when successfull

	


This will permanently delete test scheduler rerun dates. Are you sure?


ToDo Flows:
- Flow to take into account different integrations sharing the same boomi env
    - reach out to boomi to pull common info for each fileTypeId
- SFTP details retrieval from Dimensions (taken into account password should not be displayed and it'll be encrypted)
- File template download (should it be included in the metadata? need to verify the template file)
- Auth Flow (entitlements)


NEW QUESTIONS:
- Are sftp connections for a given template shared among all templates?
  A: one template associated to one connection
- How are we going to determine entitlements for Dimensions only and joint customers? How are these entitlements/permissions going to be added to users? 
  A: Pending (Niranjan said validate access token can return some user info we can use to determine TIP entitlements)
- Are Joint customers supposed to see different dashboards if the come from different sources? (sources: from dimensions or usual TIP login)
  A: yes


for Dimensions:
- Is template from the Overview page small enough to include it in the metadata?
  A: Not big, can be included in the metadata (name of the csv file to be donwloaded TBD)
- Same template, mutlitple integrations, what's the point if they are gonna share the same fields?
- Is Test Configuration going to be present in the Setup step?
  A: yes
- Just for verification, is TIP pulling SFTP from dimensions? If so, we also need to keep track of what SFTP was selected during GP by calling to boomi once the Setup Page was loaded (two calls will happen at this point)
  A: Dimensions will return the SFTP connection slected when retrieving the list of SFTP connections 
- Is there an endpoint in Dimensions already to get AccountId and EnvironmentId?
  A: Will be created


for TIP:
- boomi-dimensions-setup-worker needs to reach out to TMS using tms-helper-library. Given vanity url, client id, client secret, etc. are going to be returned by TMS, we should probably enhance the tms-helper-lib ?
