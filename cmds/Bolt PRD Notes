Dimensions side -> Integrtaion Quick Setup is clicked
 - TIP Dashbaord is loaded in a new tab (no sign in required, somehow the token should retrieved and sent to TIP)
 - TIP UI needs to be updated to receive the login params and skip the regular login flow
 	- Add Dimensions IDP to Dashboard
 	- Display company name if user comes from PRO -> DImensions
 	- Don't display company name if user comes from Dimensions only
 	- Populate username
 	- Schedule a meeting with Mark and Will to ask a few questions related to this
 - Last Run and Status will be displayed for Joint Customer, for now it'll be blank unless Dimensions sends us the info
 - Schedule column in the Dashboard for boomi integrations is not a cron expresion, UI needs to be updated to show the right value
 	- Q: How are we going to implement this? 
 	- A: 
 - For 2c ask in the StandUp Teams chat (Question 1)
 - Sign Out option in TIP shouldnâ€™t be provided for the users coming from Dimensions
 - For 5aa, we'll need to check schedule transfer field and if it's null/empty, proceed to delete the integration. If not, then display message from the PRD doc
 - For 6a, we need to update change history ro include new trasnfer fields used in Boomi integrations
 - Think about how to deploy metadata for the multiple Boomi templates given we're gonna have multiple DCs
 - For 7e, further discussion is needed to know how it'll be implemented
 - We dont support links in static page entries, pending question to review in the PRD
 - Need to implement radio buttons in static page entry
 - Need to check if there's a security implication of stringify the CRT csv file uploaded in the client side (stringified version of csv will be sent to the BE to be uploaded to Boomi later)

Questions:
1. How do we know where the user came from before he/she was on Dimensions? (How do we know the user come from Pro -> Dimensions -> TIP Dashbaord or just Dimensions -> TIP Dashboard)
	- Answer: Dimensions will add a query param so that dashboard knows the user is coming from Dimensions
2. How does TIP know what IDP to use when coming from dimensions, given that dimensions is not our OPP authn identity provider
3. For 2H, is it fair to assume "All the integrations" refers to all Boomi Integrations?
4. What should TIP do about previously created integrations in Dimensions? TIP won't have that info unless there's some kind of migration
5. For 4a, are you referring to Run in the TIP Dashboard main screen (kabab menu) or in the Scheduling Page (or both)?
6. For 4a, is the second bulletpoint referring to last status and last run date?
7. For 5a, we already display a confirmation message but with different text
8. For 5aa, is there a way to delete a schedule for an integration in Dimensions? Because if it's not possible, how would the user delete an integration in the UI side?
9. For 7d, what should we do for joint customers
10. Don't understand 8b

- Do CRTs depend on Parameters? Also, if we're going to PRD needs to be updated to reflect the parameters that will be used in metadata for CRTs and GP.
- Sync attach/install iPack and create CRTs in Boomi, and load GP when successfull

	


This will permanently delete test scheduler rerun dates. Are you sure?


ToDo Flows:
- Flow to take into account different integrations sharing the same boomi env
    - reach out to boomi to pull common info for each fileTypeId
- SFTP details retrieval from Dimensions (taken into account password should not be displayed and it'll be encrypted)
- File template download (should it be included in the metadata? need to verify the template file)
- Auth Flow (entitlements)


NEW QUESTIONS:
- Are sftp connections for a given template shared among all templates?
  A: one template associated to one connection
- How are we going to determine entitlements for Dimensions only and joint customers? How are these entitlements/permissions going to be added to users? 
  A: Pending (Niranjan said validate access token can return some user info we can use to determine TIP entitlements)
- Are Joint customers supposed to see different dashboards if the come from different sources? (sources: from dimensions or usual TIP login)
  A: yes


for Dimensions:
- Is template from the Overview page small enough to include it in the metadata?
  A: Not big, can be included in the metadata (name of the csv file to be donwloaded TBD)
- Same template, mutlitple integrations, what's the point if they are gonna share the same fields?
- Is Test Configuration going to be present in the Setup step?
  A: yes
- Just for verification, is TIP pulling SFTP from dimensions? If so, we also need to keep track of what SFTP was selected during GP by calling to boomi once the Setup Page was loaded (two calls will happen at this point)
  A: Dimensions will return the SFTP connection slected when retrieving the list of SFTP connections 
- Is there an endpoint in Dimensions already to get AccountId and EnvironmentId?
  A: Will be created
- Do we also need to install the ipack instance when installing the ipack?
  A: Yes
- Where are we going to store creds for Dimensions API tenants if TMS can't store sensitive data?
  A: Vault
- Get AccId and EnvId contract from Niranjan
  A: Under construction
- Can files be selectable in the file picker for sending the info to boomi/dimensions?
  A: 
- Q: For notifications via email, does Dimensions API accept email so they can notify users of the integration status?
  A:
- Q: Ask if we're going to either have scheduler to run integrations after clicking Finish or having an extra step to show a dialog with all file status (run won't be enabled until all files are successfully scanned)
  A: When user clicks finish, we're going to emit usual integration updated event, which is going to trigger
     1. Create falcon process (Update SFTP connection in Dimensions)
     2. Create schedule for the falcon process if schedule was selected
     3. 
- Q: In the MLD, for SFTP test connection, will the API only return 200s and 500s? What about 401?
  A:
- Missing response from GET SFTP connections request

for TIP:
- boomi-dimensions-setup-worker needs to reach out to TMS using tms-helper-library. Given vanity url, client id, client secret, etc. are going to be returned by TMS, we should probably enhance the tms-helper-lib ?


TMS Meeting Notes regarding new fields to be added to extension:
- TMS has a lot on the plate
- TMS new version should be released on September, but depending on requests, it might be pushed to a later date
- Adding extensions and fields in the new version is easier than current version
- We requested if it's possible to add this only for the dev env for development process and TMS prod will meet with TMS developers Friday next week to get an idea of the effort for this.
- New TMS version extensions is not backwards compatible with current version, meaning if we want to use new version we would need to update our code
- Next step for us would be:
  - discuss if we actually need the other fields given that we only need vanity url, and that field will be added as a service instance, not to the extension (in the extension we already have the dimensions tenantId). If we only add vanity url in a service instance, it would remove the dependency we have with TMS.
  - If we decide we want to proceed with the addition of all fields in the quip doc (https://ukg.quip.com/N4keAMr2duE3/New-Fields-in-TMS-draft) for dev and prod envs, Kim Alonso suggested to reach out to Kevin Florez from provisioning because they need to be aware of the manual process of adding values to those fields (they won't be happy with it given they are trying to remove as much manual process as needed, according to Kim)
  - I'll follow up next week with Kim regarding the meeting they'll have with TMS devs

To Do for development:
- Add dimensions fields to TMS (tenantId, vanityUrl, solutionId, apiGatewayUrl?, stackId, tenantShortName)
    -> We won't add anything to the extensions, just vanityUrla ad apiGatewayUrl to the service instances
- Setup Vault (any path for now until we get a definitive path with new certs, we need to meet with security and TMS teams)
- Verify we can retrieve PRO tenantId from session
- Verify gateway can convert SAML token to
- Verify Time.WorkforceDimensions.Web

TO KEEP IN MIND FOR FUTURE ITERATIONS

For Hyperfind:
 - default value will need to be added to the metadata GP and will not be used in the UI but in the backend to send the create flacon process request. transfer field name maybe: dimensions_defaultHyperfindValue
 - selected value will be stored in transfer field dimensions_selectedHyperfindValue and it will be overriden during GP. This value will be used when running the falcon process

For scheduling:
- Updating a schedule uses a different API call, when sending a request to run and integration based on a schedule, a schedule id is returned, we need to add that schedule id to the integrationId -> falconProcessId mapping.

For CRT:
 - when uploading new CRT file, we need to evict the CRT data in Dimensions

Should we consider making boomi-data-proxy a library
- yes (discuss tomorrow)

Schedule doesnt depend on files, it can be sent to Dimensions before the files are ready

Should we remove dimensions-data-proxy?
